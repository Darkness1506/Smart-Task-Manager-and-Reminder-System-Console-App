The Smart Task Manager & Reminder System is a console-based application developed using Core Java that helps users efficiently manage daily tasks. The system allows users to create, update, delete, prioritize, and track tasks with due dates. It also features a background reminder mechanism that notifies users about upcoming or overdue tasks.

This project is designed to demonstrate strong understanding of Core Java concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java Collections, File Handling, Multithreading, Exception Handling, and the Java Time API—without using any external frameworks or libraries.

Note: I am not having out folder uploaded and to run the project used VS Code or any other IDE so the project will run properly and the codes are available in the src folders to view.
